# Alternative Deployment Method

Since SSH is not working, here's an alternative approach:

## Option 1: Manual Upload via Web Interface
1. Create a simple HTTP server locally to serve files
2. Download files from the server using wget/curl
3. Upload to production server

## Option 2: Use GitHub Actions
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Set up GitHub Actions for automatic deployment
3. Configure server to pull from GitHub

## Option 3: Direct Server Access
1. Access server through AWS Console
2. Upload files via AWS interface
3. Configure manually

## Current Status:
- ✅ Production build created (220KB optimized)
- ✅ Server configuration ready
- ✅ PM2 and Nginx configs prepared
- ❌ SSH connection failing

## Next Steps:
1. Fix SSH connection or use alternative method
2. Upload files to server
3. Start application with PM2
4. Configure Nginx
5. Test application

## Files Ready for Deployment:
- dist/ (production build)
- server-production.js (backend server)
- package.json (dependencies)
- public/IQOS_logo_nbw.png (logo)
- All configuration files
